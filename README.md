# Timetable_Scheduling_by_CSP
This Python project implements a Course Scheduling System using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach with backtracking search. The goal is to generate a conflict-free schedule for a large number of university courses across multiple classrooms and timeslots, ensuring no two conflicting courses occur at the same time and location.
